For the model to function, the cityscapes data set is required
Specifically the following two datasets:
- gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241mb) 
- leftImg8Bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB)

Both datasets must be stored in a direcory named "cityscape_data", 
with the dataset directories named "gtFine" and "leftImg8bit" respectively.
The resulting direcory structure should look somthing like:

/sky_seg_model
    /venv
    /sky_seg
    /cityscape_data
        /gtFine
        /leftImg8bit
    /dataset_info.txt
    /...

(note, if you want your dataset to have a different direcory format from that, 
you will need to change the direcory specifications in ./sky_seg/dataset_tools.py)
